 STEP-3: 
Check for Updates Ensure your operating system, drivers, and software are up to date. Sometimes,updating can resolve compatibility or security issues updating can resolves.

 STEP-4: 
Restart the System A simple restart can often fix minor glitches and improve system performance.

 STEP-5: 
Check Hardware If it's a hardware-related issue, ensure that all hardware components are properly connected and functioning. Look for loose cables, overheating, or hardware failures.

 STEP-6:
Run Diagnostic Tools Use built-in diagnostic tools provided by the operating system to identify hardware or software problems.

 STEP-7:
Review Event Logs Check the system logs for error messages or warnings that might provide clues about the issue. In Windows, you can use the Event Viewer; in Linux, check syslog or journalctl.

 STEP-8:
Remove Recently Installed Software If the problem started after installing new software, consider uninstalling it to see if that resolves the issue.

 STEP-9: 
Safe Mode Boot the system into safe mode to check if the problem persists. Safe mode loads the OS with minimal drivers and can help identify if third-party software is causing the issue.

 STEP-10:
Virus and Malware Scan Perform a full system scan for viruses and malware using reputable antivirus software.

 STEP-11: 
Check Disk and File System Use built-in utilities like chkdsk (Windows) or fsck (Linux) to scan and repair disk errors and file system issues

 STEP-12:
Update Drivers Ensure that your hardware drivers (graphics, sound, network) are up to date. Outdated drivers can cause various problems.

 STEP-13: 
Restore the System If applicable, consider using system restore points to revert your system to a previous state when it was working correctly.

 STEP-14: 
Backup Data If all else fails and you suspect a major issue, back up your important data before attempting any major repairs or reinstallations.
